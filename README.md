# Quality Assurance with Chai

This is the code for FCC the Quality Assurance with Chai lessons. 
<br>Instructions for completing these lessons start at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/quality-assurance-and-testing-with-chai/

## There are 2 tests: Unit tests & functional tests
Unit tests about assertions, deep equality, truthiness, typeOf, propertyof and so on...
Functional tests on API endpoints using chai-http, PUT method, runing tests on headless browser.

## Chai
Chai is an excellent JavaScript library with a bunch of methods that can be used to ensure our code behaves as expected. 
<br >It makes testing much easier by giving users lots of assertions that can run against the code.
